# Machine-Learning-Driven-Cross-Sectional-Equity-Momentum-Strategy-with-Simulated-Portfolio

## Overview
This project implements a systematic trading strategy that leverages machine learning to predict short-term relative price movements within a universe of liquid equities. The core objective is to construct and simulate a market-neutral portfolio, aiming to profit from relative outperformance and underperformance while minimizing exposure to overall market direction. It's built with a strong focus on data-driven signal generation, robust backtesting methodologies, and the application of modern machine learning techniques to financial datasets.
Problem Statement: Generating Consistent, Market-Neutral Alpha in Liquid Equity Markets
## The Challenge:
In increasingly efficient and interconnected global equity markets, consistently generating absolute returns (alpha) by predicting the overall direction of individual stocks or the broader market is exceptionally challenging. Traditional directional long-only or long-short strategies are often highly correlated with market movements, exposing portfolios to significant systematic risk. Furthermore, relying on human intuition or simple rule-based strategies often fails to capture the subtle, complex, and dynamic non-linear relationships present in vast, multi-dimensional financial datasets.

## The Opportunity:
While predicting absolute price movements is difficult, there exists a persistent opportunity to identify relative mispricings or relative momentum within a universe of liquid equities. That is, certain stocks may consistently outperform their peers, or vice-versa, over short-to-medium time horizons, irrespective of the overall market's direction. Extracting these relative signals requires sophisticated analytical tools capable of processing large volumes of diverse data.

## The Problem this Project Investigates and Solves:
This project investigates the problem of extracting robust, predictive signals for cross-sectional equity momentum from historical financial data and leveraging these signals to construct a consistently profitable, market-neutral portfolio.

## Specifically, the project aims to solve:

# The Signal Extraction Problem: 
How can we effectively parse and analyze large, noisy financial datasets (price, volume, fundamental data, etc.) to uncover subtle, non-linear relationships that predict the relative future performance of individual stocks within a defined universe? Traditional linear models or simple heuristics often fall short in identifying these complex patterns.

# The Portfolio Construction Problem: 
Given these relative performance predictions, how can we systematically construct a dollar-neutral portfolio that maximizes exposure to predicted outperformance (long positions) and underperformance (short positions), while simultaneously minimizing exposure to broad market movements and other unwanted systemic factors?

# The Reproducibility & Scalability Problem: 
How can we build a robust, modular, and systematically testable framework for developing, backtesting, and evaluating such strategies, ensuring that research insights can be reliably translated into actionable trading logic?

## The Solution Proposed by this Project:
# This project addresses these challenges by:

Applying advanced machine learning techniques (e.g., ensemble models like Gradient Boosting) to a rich set of engineered cross-sectional features to predict relative equity performance.

Developing a systematic framework for constructing and rebalancing a dollar-neutral portfolio based on these ML-driven predictions, thereby aiming to generate alpha primarily from the bid-ask spread and relative price movements rather than overall market direction.

Implementing a robust, modular, and backtested pipeline that adheres to software engineering best practices, allowing for reproducible research, rigorous performance evaluation, and a clear path towards potential deployment.

## Features
Automated Data Acquisition: Downloads historical daily price and volume data for a selected universe of liquid equities.
Comprehensive Feature Engineering: Generates a rich set of predictive features, including various technical indicators and cross-sectional momentum signals, ensuring proper time-series alignment to prevent look-ahead bias.
Machine Learning Model Training: Utilizes powerful ensemble models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM) trained using walk-forward validation to predict relative stock performance.
Target Variable Definition: Clearly defines a target for prediction, typically based on next-day relative stock returns or rankings.
Simulated Market-Neutral Portfolio: Constructs a dollar-neutral portfolio by simultaneously taking long positions in predicted outperformers and short positions in predicted underperformers.
Basic Backtesting Framework: Simulates the strategy's performance over historical data, incorporating realistic assumptions like transaction costs.
Performance Evaluation: Calculates and visualizes key quantitative finance metrics, including Sharpe Ratio, Maximum Drawdown, Annualized Returns, Volatility, and crucially, demonstrates market neutrality (low correlation to the broad market).
Analysis & Visualization: Provides tools to visualize model predictions, portfolio performance, and feature importance.
## How It Works
The project follows a typical systematic trading research pipeline:

Data Collection: Historical daily data for a defined universe of stocks is fetched and preprocessed.
Feature Generation: A variety of features are computed from the raw data, explicitly focusing on cross-sectional insights and ensuring no future information is leaked.

Model Training & Prediction: A machine learning model is trained on a rolling window of historical data to learn the relationship between features and future relative performance. On each subsequent simulated day, the trained model makes predictions.

Strategy Execution (Simulation): Based on the model's predictions, the strategy identifies the top and bottom performing stocks. A dollar-neutral portfolio is then constructed by longing the predicted outperformers and shorting the predicted underperformers.

Backtesting & Evaluation: The portfolio's daily returns are tracked, and its performance is rigorously evaluated against key quantitative metrics over the entire simulation period.

## Technical Stack
Python: The core programming language for the entire pipeline.
pandas & numpy: For efficient data manipulation and numerical operations.
scikit-learn: For various machine learning algorithms and utilities (e.g., model selection, preprocessing).
xgboost / lightgbm: High-performance gradient boosting libraries for predictive modeling.
yfinance: For convenient access to historical stock data.
matplotlib & seaborn: For powerful and clear data visualization.
statsmodels (Optional): For additional statistical analysis.

## Results & Performance Highlights
(This section should be filled in after you run your project and get actual results. Here's an example of what you might highlight):

After running the backtest on a universe of S&P 500 constituents from [Start Date] to [End Date], the strategy demonstrated:

An annualized return of [X]% with an annualized volatility of [Y]%.

A Sharpe Ratio of [Z], indicating favorable risk-adjusted returns.

A maximum drawdown of [D]%, suggesting controlled downside risk.

Crucially, the portfolio returns showed a correlation of [C] (e.g., 0.15) to the S&P 500 index, effectively demonstrating its market-neutral characteristic.

Feature importance analysis revealed that [mention 1-2 key features, e.g., "cross-sectional relative strength" or "volume divergence"] were strong predictors of relative stock performance.

## Future Enhancements
This project serves as a robust foundation. Potential areas for further development include:

Advanced Risk Management: Implementing sophisticated risk models (e.g., VaR, CVaR), factor exposure management, or dynamic position sizing.

Alternative Data Sources: Incorporating non-traditional data (e.g., sentiment data, satellite imagery, news analytics) to generate new signals.

Higher-Frequency Signals: Adapting the framework for intraday data and higher-frequency trading signals.

Portfolio Optimization: Exploring more complex portfolio construction techniques beyond simple dollar neutrality, such as mean-variance optimization or risk-parity.

Model Ensembling/Stacking: Combining predictions from multiple diverse machine learning models for improved robustness.

Reinforcement Learning: Exploring RL agents for dynamic strategy adaptation.
